 - Create and display records  (Teachers and Students)
 - Search for records

 - Created a "base.js" file for reusing some functions on the MODAL 
 - Created a validation to prevent blank fields. Used Html temporary message.
 - Animation with lottie files when resource is created/updated or deleted.  
 

## Extra functionalities created
- Implemented the **pagination** logic based on the total number of records returned from DATABASE. In order to do that, 
created a sub-query to return the total number of records for both teachers and students. Then used this information to calculate the number of pages there will be.
- The "first", "second", "before last" and "last" pages are always displayed on the screen. Also, the "selected page", page "before" the selected and page "after" the selected page are display. For pages numbers being displayed, if there are more than 2 pages in between,  (...) is shown.
